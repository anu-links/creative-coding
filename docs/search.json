    "text": "The goal of this creative coding workshop is so that we can create a space where we can commune to discuss coding while having some fun with art. If this workshop is successful, there may be opportunities to repeat this in the future and in essence, create a community where creative coders can connect. We would also love to showcase the generative art you create on this website!\nWhile the primary materials are geared towards those who are proficient in R, those who want to come and join are welcomed!\nThank you to Nat Thomas, Senior Advisor for Diversity and Culture at CoS, for providing us with the room and afternoon tea for this activity."
